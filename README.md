# Before install
You must realize, you need *some credentionals* to make a deploy, so after clone your project make .env file and create some variables

*DATABASE_URL - actualy dont need. it takes from docker configuration files
*USER_NAME - your name, which will be shown on the deployes app page
*USER_URL - some kind of your personal URL

# Install
For local deploy follow instructions below:
    *- make git clone <thisrepo>
    *- chmod +x /liteme.sh
    *- ./liftme
